# Letterboxd Web Scraper (In progress)
## Find yourself a random movie using "Random Movie Roulette" list by Tobias Andersen

### Deployed on [https://letterboxd-web-scraper.vercel.app/](https://letterboxd-web-scraper.vercel.app/)

Currently it will scrape Letterboxd for the movie title, and any information needed to piece together the image url for the poster.
If the letterboxd link does not work, we can fetch the poster by using "themoviedb.org"'s API.
